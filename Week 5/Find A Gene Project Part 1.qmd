## Q1. Tell me the name of a protein you are interested in. Include the species and the accession number. This can be a human protein or a protein from any other species as long as it's function is known.

**Name:** kinesin family member 11

**Accession:** NP_004514

**Species:** Homo sapiens

**Function:** Enables ATP, microtubule, nucleotide, protein, and protein kinase binding. It also enables microtubule and plus-end-directed microtubule motor activities.


## Q2. Perform a BLAST search against a DNA database, such as a database consisting of genomic DNA or ESTs. The BLAST server can be at NCBI or elsewhere. Include details of the BLAST method used, database searched and any limits applied (e.g. Organism).


**Method:** TBLASTN search against Mus musculus (House mouse) ESTs

**Database:** Expressed Sequence Tags (est)

**Organism:** Mus musculus (taxid:10090)

**Chosen Match:** Accession CN533430.1, a 722 base pair clone from Mus musculus.

## Q3. Gather information about this “novel” protein. At a minimum, show me the protein sequence of the “novel” protein as displayed in your BLAST results from [Q2] as FASTA format (you can copy and paste the aligned sequence subject lines from your BLAST result page if necessary) or translate your novel DNA sequence using a tool called EMBOSS Transeq at the EBI. Don’t forget to translate all six reading frames; the ORF (open reading frame) is likely to be the longest sequence without a stop codon. It may not start with a methionine if you don’t have the complete coding region. Make sure the sequence you provide includes a header/subject line and is in traditional FASTA format.

## Q4. Prove that this gene, and its corresponding protein, are novel. For the purposes of this project, “novel” is defined as follows. Take the protein sequence (your answer to [Q3]), and use it as a query in a blastp search of the nr database at NCBI.


• If there is a match with 100% amino acid identity to a protein in the database, from the same species, then your protein is NOT novel (even if the match is to a protein with a name such as “unknown”). Someone has already found and annotated this sequence, and assigned it an accession number.

• If the top match reported has less than 100% identity, then it is likely that your protein is novel, and you have succeeded.

• If there is a match with 100% identity, but to a different species than the one you started with, then you have likely succeeded in finding a novel gene.

• If there are no database matches to the original query from [Q1], this indicates that you have partially succeeded: yes, you may have found a new gene, but no, it is not actually homologous to the original query. You should probably start over.

**Description:** A BLASTP search against NR database yielded a top hit result to a protein from Rattus norvegicus (NP_001162583.1).

**Species:** Rattus norvegicus

**Name:** kinesin-like protein KIF11 [Rattus norvegicus]

**Percent Identity:** 99.16%. Since the top match has less than 100% identity, this must mean the protein is novel because there is no identical match that is 100% to this specific species in the protein database.
